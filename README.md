Chinese Notebook is a responsive web app meant to help beginning Chinese speakers to practice reading Chinese characters. 

Several elementary-level Chinese dialogues are included in this notebook. They are organized into thematic lessons, with two dialogues included per lesson. Each dialogue features an audio file to enhance the reading experience and to aid listening comprehension. 

The responsive features were written with **CSS3** media queries and Twitter **Bootstrap**. The custom audio player was written in **JavaScript**. The popups, smooth-scroll effect, and modal functionality use methods from the **jQuery** library. The routing for the view was written in **AngularJS**. A custom **PHP** contact form is included in the folder tree, and it will be enabled once additional scripts have been included to support Firebase operability.
