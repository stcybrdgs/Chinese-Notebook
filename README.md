Chinese Notebook is an elementary-level Chinese reader featuring 8 original dialogues and a custom audio player.

The custom audio player was written in **JavaScript**. The popups, smooth-scroll effect, and modal functionality use methods from the **jQuery** library. The routing for the view was written in **AngularJS**. A custom **PHP** contact form is included in the folder tree and will be enabled once additional scripts are included to support Firebase operability.
