Chinese Notebook is an elementary-level Chinese reader featuring 8 original dialogues and a custom audio player. 

The custom audio player was written in JavaScript. The popups, smooth-scroll effect, and modal functionality use methods from the jQuery library. The routing for the view was written in AngularJS. A custom contact form was written in PHP and will be enabled once additional scripts have been included to support Firebase operability. 

Chinese Notebook is hosted as a web app on Firebase at [https://chinesenotebook.firebaseapp.com](https://chinesenotebook.firebaseapp.com).
