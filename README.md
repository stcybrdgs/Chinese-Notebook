Chinese Notebook is an elementary-level Chinese reader featuring 8 original dialogues and a custom audio player. 

The custom audio player was written in **JavaScript**. The popups, smooth-scroll effect, and modal functionality use methods from the **jQuery** library. The routing for the view was written in **AngularJS**. A custom #PHP contact form has been written and will be enabled once additional scripts are included to support Firebase operability. 

Chinese Notebook is hosted as a web app on **Firebase** at [https://chinesenotebook.firebaseapp.com](https://chinesenotebook.firebaseapp.com).
